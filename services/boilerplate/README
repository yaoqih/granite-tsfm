This directory contains boilerplate code that is
not intended to be a standalone module. Instead
the code from this folder gets copied to the suitable
locations during the execution of relevant make target
involved in the packaging and building of the various
service runtimes.

As such, we are breaking the "standalone" design
goal of the various runtimes a bit in that they
now have a common code dependency. This is necessary
to avoid undue code duplication with the concurrent
maintenance overheads it incurs.
